# About
A Minecraft plugin that allows players to receive rewards after a certain period of time.

The original author of the plugin was [Halflove](https://github.com/HalfloveJAR), but he lost interest in further maintenance, so I decided to start working on the plugin to optimize and improve it regularly.
